Here are a few highlights:\n\n1. **DevOps Engineer at I&M Bank**: I implemented DevOps and SRE best practices, engineered cloud infrastructure on AWS, and automated the deployment of microservices, contributing to a 99.9% uptime for core banking applications.\n\n2. **Service Reliability Engineer at Safaricom**: I enhanced monitoring for critical services, transitioned from Dynatrace to ELK Stack which saved costs by 26%, and implemented Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring containerized platforms.\n\n3. **Embedded Systems and IoT Training at Gearbox**: I developed course outlines and trained students on embedded systems, leading to significant growth in enrollment and improving the curriculum's quality.\n\n4. **Automation Projects**: I developed a door automation system using Raspberry Pi and ESP32 during my internship, which incorporated user authentication via RFID and keypad access.\n\nThese experiences have helped me build a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, monitoring, automation, and teaching in technology. If you're interested in specific areas or further details about any project, just let me know!",

During this process, I set up indices, queries, and dashboards to visualize and analyze the collected data. \n\nIf you have specific questions about using Elasticsearch or any part of the ELK Stack, feel free to ask!",
